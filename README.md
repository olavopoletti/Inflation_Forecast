# Inflation Forecast
Evidence suggests that the processes producing inflation change over time. The data relevant to determine the inflation rate during recessions may not be influential during growth periods. That is, the model might change with Business Cycles. It is not straightforward to identify at which point of a cycle the economy is currently on, which hinders the performance of structural approaches. And also increases the time necessary to train data-driven multivariate models. Thus, an univariate, nonlinear model seems to be a good starting point.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to learn long sequences o data. It does not rely on pre-specified structures or windows - a good fit for forecasting time series.
